## Description

ContigR is a powerful tool that combines the efficiency of C++ with the statistical capabilities of R to analyze genomic contigs. It provides functionality for:

- Processing FASTA files
- Analyzing contig overlaps
- Calculating coverage and GC content
- Visualizing contig statistics
- Generating detailed reports

```

## Usage

1. Prepare your FASTA file with contigs
2. Run the analysis:
```R
Rscript run_analysis.R input.fasta
```

## Output
